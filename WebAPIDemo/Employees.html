<!-- What is same origin policy? Browsers allow a web page to make AJAX requests only with in the same domain. Browser 
security prevents a web page from making AJAX requests to another domain. This is called same origin policy.
- The following 2 URLs have the same origin http://localhost:1234/api/employees, http://localhost:1234/Employees.html.
- The following 2 URLs have different origins, because they have different port numbers (1234 v/s 5678)
http://localhost:1234/api/employees, http://localhost:5678/Employees.html
- The following 2 URLs have different origins, because they have different domains (.com v/s .net)
http://pragimtech.com/api/employees, http://pragimtech.net/Employees.html
- The following 2 URLs have different origins, because they have different schemes (http v/s https)
https://pragimtech.com/api/employees, http://pragimtech.net/Employees.html

Browsers does not allow cross domain ajax requests. There are 2 ways to get around this problem
1.)Using JSONP (JSON with Padding), 2.)Enabling CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing)

So what is JSONP and what does it do?JSONP stands for JSON with Padding. 
All JSONP does is wraps the data in a function. So for example, if you have the following JSON object
{
    "FirstName" : "Mark",
    "LastName"  : "Hastings",
    "Gender"    : "Male",
}
JSONP will wrap the data in a function as shown below
CallbackFunction({
    "FirstName" : "Mark",
    "LastName"  : "Hastings",
    "Gender"    : "Male",
})
Browsers allow to consume JavaScript that is present in a different domain but not data.Since the data is  
wrapped in a JavaScript function, this can be consumed by a web page that is present in a different domain.

Steps to make ASP.NET Web API Service to return JSONP formatted data and consume it from a cross domain ajax request
Step 1 : To support JSONP format, execute the following command using NuGet Package Manager Console which installs 
WebApiContrib.Formatting.Jsonp package.
Install-Package WebApiContrib.Formatting.Jsonp-->
